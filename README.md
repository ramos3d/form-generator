# Highlights

The HTML pages are generated automatically using your tables as source. Then, all you need to do is basically set up the connection file with your database access data, pick up a table and it is done. Fast, clean and easy.
* PHP >=5.6
* Bootstrap 4




# How to use it?
 1. Set your database connetion in /config/Connection.php
 2. open index.php
 3. Select your table on the right side
 4. Enjoy :)


# Important
## Did you get an Empty HTML output?
Whenever a column has no comments the HTML labels won't be created properly. 
So, no comments, no fields.

Feel free to use it and, if it's possible, let me know where and how you are using it!
